title: 'Princess White Noise and the Frog of Procrastination'
---

It's been a few months now I've had this site all ready and full of Lorem Ipsum text, waiting, longing, yearning only for that inaugural post that would allow it to finally become [_a real blog_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pguMUFyJ3_U).

There was just one problem: I simply couldn't find a place (or time, really, either would have done, I'm not fussy that way) to actually sit down and start writing. Everywhere was either too hot, too cold, too sunny, too rainy, too quiet, too loud, too inhospitable for computers, too inhospitable for people, too hospitable for people (and hence too crowded) or some function of all of the above and a dozen other variables I couldn't even think of.

And I know that in the world most of us think we live in, the punchline or moral lesson of this story would be about how I was only making up all those things as excuses to procrastinate, and when I stopped doing that and _changed my mindset_ all these places were instantly transformed like princess-kissed frogs into the perfect environment for creating immortal works of literature - but that wasn't what happened.

What did happen was that, driven to distraction by the smallest sound I heard, I decided to try tuning it out with a white noise audio clip. This worked like a charm to get me started, and then once I'd started, I didn't even need it any more! (I guess white noise is the real princess here? I'd watch that movie - it'd have to be a sci-fi/surrealist non-conventional romance, and no way I'm passing that up.)

This sort of thing - situations that feel frustrating and impossible but that only require one tiny thing (or two tiny things, the point is, a not-too-large number of not-too-large things) to change in order for everything to be as God and Nature meant it and as mice and men planned it - will probably be a significant part of what I write about here, mostly because it happens to me so very often, I'm not even sure I'd recognize my life without it.

And the rest of it - well, I don't know either, and I'm going to have to write it to find out.
