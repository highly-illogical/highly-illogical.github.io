title: hitchens on dictatorship

Christopher Hitchens, in _Hitch-22: A Memoir_:

> The true essence of a dictatorship is in fact not its regularity but its unpredictability and caprice; those who live under it must never be able to relax, must never be quite sure if they have followed the rules correctly or not.

<!--more-->I'd observed this in my [last post]({{site.baseurl}}{%post_url 2020-12-22-us-vs-them %}) too.

> [The followers] must remain in a state of uncertainty about whether they are in or out of favour with the cult, and whether they are therefore to be saved or damned... If they are certain about their fate, they will no longer respond to manipulation - so they must be made to feel that their fate is undecided, that it will depend on their actions and their commitment to the cult.

I'm glad someone else has said this before (apart from it being a ubiquitous theme in dystopian and absurdist literature.)
