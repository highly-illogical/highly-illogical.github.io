title: fascism/cults.

The popular image of cults is that of groups of people who are brainwashed by a leader into giving up their individuality and becoming part of a hivemind, holding bizarre supernatural or mystical beliefs and leading a conformist collective lifestyle that appears deranged and zombie-like to outside observers. To most people (including me, till recently), the notion of a cult seems strange and weird and far removed from anything they've ever seen or ever expect to see in their own lives. They can't imagine how such brainwashing could ever work on a sane and healthy human being, and they certainly can't imagine that it could ever work on them.<!--more-->

But to anyone who investigates cults more deeply, it's clear that it could work on any of us - and probably has worked, at one time or another, on all of us. Cult dynamics aren't black magic. They're ordinary group dynamics, sharpened and manipulated and taken to an extreme in very specific ways. This becomes apparent when you stop focusing on the specifics of the cult's crazy beliefs and instead look for deeper structural and psychological commonalities.

One of these commonalities is that all cults seem to be driven by a dream of perfection or utopia. Whether it's the Scientologist dream of "clearing" the planet of unhappiness, trauma and mental illness, or the Heaven's Gate dream of going on to "the evolutionary level above human" (TELAH), or Jim Jones's dream of "apostolic socialism", all cults, in one way or another, seem to promise their members transcendence of the human condition and freedom from all the flaws and miseries and misfortunes that have plagued their lives on earth so far.

And it makes perfect sense that they would do that. Because what else, other than a dream of perfection, could induce ordinary people to believe and do such wild, insane and frequently horrific things as cult members have been known to do? How can a mass suicide or murder or decades of abuse and exploitation be rationalized, except by claiming that it's in the service of a cause greater than anything known to mere mortals? The utopian promise is a blank check that allows the cult to get away with the most heinous crimes in this world so long as it can claim they are necessary to lead the followers into the next one.

How different is this from the religious dream of an eternal afterlife in heaven, or the Communist dream of a society of plenty without coercion or exploitation? Probably not very. There's that saying about how a cult is a religion you don't like - and if we're including secular cults, it might simply be a group you don't like. But not every group motivates its followers to act by holding out utopian promises - so it's more accurate to say that groups can exist on a continuum from cultic to non-cultic, and there's usually a set of co-occurring pathologies in cultic groups that distinguishes them from non-cultic groups.

What this post is about is whether or not these pathologies exist in fascism.

Fascism appears to be similar to cult ideologies in many ways - notably being authoritarian and repressive and anti-individualistic and organized around a charismatic leader - but in other ways it doesn't quite seem to fit the cult pattern. It seems to appeal not to people's virtuous instincts, to their sense of justice or their dream of building a better world, but directly to their brutishness, to their lust for power and contempt for the weak. The idealistic element doesn't seem to be present at all - it simply seems to encourage people's worst natures without any justification or rationalization. Cults are dystopian nightmares cloaked in utopian dreams, but fascism just sounds like a nakedly dystopian ideology that makes no pretensions to anything higher or better than pure selfishness and hatred.

So - is fascism a cult ideology or not? And if not, do we need to alter the definition of a cult to include it in some way?

It'll probably take more than one post to sketch out any sort of answer to these questions, but I want to start by comparing the criteria for identifying a group as a cult with the criteria for identifying a political system as fascism. While there's no single accepted set of criteria for either of them, I'm going to use the ones I've found particularly helpful in explaining how these systems work: for cults, [Robert Jay Lifton's eight criteria of thought reform](https://culteducation.com/brainwashing/26424-thought-reform-and-the-psychology-of-totalism.html) (which he outlines in a book about Chinese Communist indoctrination), and for fascism, [Umberto Eco's essay on Ur-Fascism](http://www.pegc.us/archive/Articles/eco_ur-fascism.pdf).

(I'm not going to take the criteria one-by-one in order, instead I'm going to rearrange and group them in a way that makes sense to me.)

According to Lifton, in the totalistic environment, there is a *demand for purity* that manifests in the following way:

> ...the experiential world is sharply divided into the pure and the impure, into the absolutely good and the absolutely evil. The good and the pure are of course those ideas, feelings, and actions which are consistent with the totalist ideology and policy; anything else is apt to be relegated to the bad and the impure. Nothing human is immune from the flood of stern moral judgments. All "taints" and "poisons" which contribute to the existing state of impurity must be searched out and eliminated.

To my mind, this is the essential feature from which everything else follows. At the heart of the cult lies an existential divide between insiders and outsiders, patriots and traitors, the saved and the damned. Those who are within the cult, the insiders, the patriots, the faithful, are pure and good and will be saved, while the outsiders, the traitors, the heretics and infidels, are impure and evil and will be damned.

There's no nuance, no in-between, no grey area, just an absolute binary between existential fulfilment and annihilation. The world outside the cult is a bleak, horrifying place, hostile to all life and goodness and virtue, uninhabitable for human beings, so that those who remain outside will in some sense lose their very existence as humans. The world within the cult is its polar opposite, warm and life-giving and nourishing, a paradise where anyone who enters will feel immediately and forever fulfilled and happy.

Faced with such a choice, there is not and cannot be any reason for anyone to remain on the outside. Those who do not join the cult either do not understand this truth, or have already lost their humanity and become so evil and degraded that they are beyond redemption. There can never be any compromise with such evil, because it is by its very nature against everything good, and therefore against the cult's very existence. If any sign of it is discovered within the cult, it must be treated as a grave danger and ruthlessly excised.

This antipathy toward compromise and nuance, this view of difference as threatening and impure, is remarked upon by Eco as well:

> For Ur-Fascism, disagreement is treason.
>
> [...] pacifism is trafficking with the enemy.
>
> [...] Ur-Fascism grows up and seeks for consensus by exploiting and exacerbating the natural fear of difference. The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus Ur-Fascism is racist by definition.

How does the cult convince its members that the world is divided into these absolute binaries, that it has solved the riddle of existence and found the path to redemption? This is where the dogma comes in - what Lifton calls the *sacred science*, a vision of an ultimate moral order that may not be questioned.

> While thus transcending ordinary concerns of logic, however, the milieu at the same time makes an exaggerated claim of airtight logic, of absolute "scientific" precision. Thus the ultimate moral vision becomes an ultimate science; and the man who dares to criticize it, or to harbor even unspoken alternative ideas, becomes not only immoral and irreverent, but also "unscientific."

The claim of absolute truth is a feature of Ur-Fascism as well, the absoluteness coming not from its "scientific" nature but from a reverence for tradition:

> Each of the original messages [in different traditions] contains a sliver of wisdom, and whenever they seem to say different or incompatible things it is only because all are alluding, allegorically, to the same primeval truth. As a consequence, there can be no advancement of learning. Truth has been already spelled out once and for all, and we can only keep interpreting its obscure message.

But how are people to be persuaded to accept this dogma as absolute, and prevented from questioning it? The cult has a variety of techniques for this - among them, as mentioned earlier, the framing of doubt and disagreement as dangerous and morally wrong, and *milieu control*, which refers to control over communication within the cultic environment (which fascism is infamous for, in the form of censorship, propaganda and surveillance). 

However, thought control is usually not possible to fully achieve by these means. What is far more effective is to make it impossible for people to question the ideology at all. This is done by *loading the language*, whereby

> The most far-reaching and complex of human problems are compressed into brief, highly reductive, definitive-sounding phrases, easily memorized and easily expressed. These become the start and finish of any ideological analysis... For an individual person, the effect of the language of ideological totalism can be summed up in one word: constriction. He is, so to speak, linguistically deprived; and since language is so central to all human experience, his capacities for thinking and feeling are immensely narrowed.

This is what Eco describes as "Newspeak" in Ur-Fascism:

> Ur-Fascism speaks Newspeak. Newspeak was invented by Orwell, in *1984*, as the official language of Ingsoc, English Socialism. But elements of Ur-Fascism are common to different forms of dictatorship. All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary, and an elementary syntax, in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning. 

and it leads to the replacement of human experiences with the falsified ideological interpretations of those experiences (in Lifton's phrase, *doctrine over person*)

> This sterile language reflects another characteristic feature of ideological totalism: the subordination of human experience to the claims of doctrine. This primacy of doctrine over person is evident in the continual shift between experience itself and the highly abstract interpretation of such experience—between genuine feelings and spurious cataloguing of feelings. 

Accepted as gospel truth, an extreme ideology justifies extreme actions. If absolute good and absolute evil have become aligned in two separate tribes, then it's natural to expect that those tribes will be at war until one of them is destroyed. Evil *will not* permit good to exist, and therefore good *must not* permit evil to exist, for its own continued existence depends on evil's annihilation.

The cult is therefore justified in taking any action necessary against anything it perceives as a danger to itself. It determines the fate of each individual, and it holds the power of salvation and damnation over ordinary people. Taking upon itself the *dispensing of existence*,

> The totalist environment draws a sharp line between those whose right to existence can be recognized, and those who possess no such right... one underlying assumption makes this arrogance mandatory: the conviction that there is just one path to true existence, just one valid mode of being, and that all others are perforce invalid and false. Totalists thus feel themselves compelled to destroy all possibilities of false existence as a means of furthering the great plan of true existence to which they are committed. 

This selectivity - where the right kind of person is allowed to exist and the wrong kind of person is not - is also characteristic of fascism, under which "traitors" can usually be deprived of their rights, arrested and shot without trial, while the voices of "patriots" are treated as the will of the people:

> For Ur-Fascism... individuals have no rights, and the People is conceived as a quality, a monolithic entity expressing the Common Will. Since no large quantity of human beings can have a common will, the Leader pretends to be their interpreter. Having lost their power of delegation, citizens do not act; they are only called on to play the role of the People. Thus the People is only a theatrical fiction... There is in our future a TV or Internet populism, in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.

All of this is presented to the followers as a simplistic, black-and-white narrative, a kind of morality play centred around a conspiracy by enemies and traitors to destroy the cult. Typically, the conspiracy will be discovered and exposed by the leaders and swift retribution against the conspirators will follow. Those who are to be cast as the villains in the morality play are provoked and manipulated into playing the part, confessing to the conspiracy or otherwise becoming complicit in the construction of the narrative, so that it appears coherent and convincing even to them, as if it had happened spontaneously.

The followers - especially when they are under threat of falling out of favour with the cult - respond to inducements and pressures to become what the cult wants them to become. This is what Lifton calls *mystical manipulation*, which

> ...assumes a no-holds-barred character, and uses every possible device at the milieu's command, no matter how bizarre or painful. Initiated from above, it seeks to provoke specific patterns of behavior and emotion in such a way that these will appear to have arisen spontaneously from within the environment. This element of planned spontaneity, directed as it is by an ostensibly omniscient group, must assume, for the manipulated, a near-mystical quality.

As Eco observes too, Ur-Fascism has an obsession with conspiracy theories:

> ...at the root of the Ur-Fascist psychology there is the obsession with a plot, possibly an international one. The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia. But the plot must also come from the inside: Jews are usually the best target because they have the advantage of being at the same time inside and outside.

In order to manipulate the followers, the cult has to create a sense of insecurity within them and link it to the existential binary it sets up. They must remain in a state of uncertainty about whether they are in or out of favour with the cult, and whether they are therefore to be saved or damned. All other rewards and punishments will pale into insignificance before the hope of salvation and the threat of damnation. If they are certain about their fate, they will no longer respond to manipulation - so they must be made to feel that their fate is undecided, that it will depend on their actions and their commitment to the cult.

There are a couple of different ways in which cults target people's insecurities. They can tell them that they're flawed and need to join the cult in order to be rid or cured of the flaw - it's a standard cult recruitment technique to make potential converts feel that they're somehow not good enough, that there's something about them that needs to be fundamentally altered, and that they can only do this if they sign up for whatever the cult is offering. Or - and this is perhaps where fascism differs slightly from other cults - they can tell them that they're *already* special, and if they don't join the cult, they will squander their special gifts or talents or qualities in a world that will not understand or value them, that may even envy or hate them for these qualities, and attempt to exploit or destroy them.

On the surface, it seems like these two approaches are quite different. One of them points out or exaggerates or even manufactures flaws in the potential convert, while the other denies all flaws and treats the potential convert as if they are perfect. But they actually converge in certain ways: the convert who acknowledges their flaw and accepts the cure or solution offered by the cult will then be pressured to deny the flaw completely, since to acknowledge it would be to say that the cult's solution didn't work. Meanwhile, the convert who joined the cult thinking it was an exclusive club for special people will find that they now have to meet extremely high expectations to retain their membership, and will be treated as flawed and unworthy if they don't meet them.

The effect of both approaches is to induce a state of simultaneous idealization and devaluation. This makes it easy to manipulate the followers, by making them feel like they might be in either of these states according to the cult's whims. They may be devalued and treated as fundamentally flawed, then offered a path to redemption, then idealized and treated as if they are completely free of the flaw, then devalued again for some other flaw - and so on.

Eco describes this ideology of simultaneous idealization and devaluation as follows:

> Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology, insofar as it is fundamentally aristocratic, and aristocratic and militaristic elitism cruelly implies contempt for the weak. Ur-Fascism can only advocate a popular elitism. Every citizen belongs to the best people of the world, the members of the party are the best among the citizens, every citizen can (or ought to) become a member of the party. But there cannot be patricians without plebeians... Since the group is hierarchically organized (according to a military model), every subordinate leader despises his own underlings, and each of them despises his inferiors. This reinforces the sense of mass elitism.

The masses are made to feel like elites, and yet at the same time also inferior and humiliated by their enemies:

> The followers must feel humiliated by the ostentatious wealth and force of their enemies. When I was a boy I was taught to think of Englishmen as the five-meal people. They ate more frequently than the poor but sober Italians. Jews are rich and help each other through a secret web of mutual assistance. However, the followers must be convinced that they can overwhelm the enemies. Thus, by a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus, the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.

In order to reconcile these contradictions - that they are flawed and impure, yet worthy of salvation, that they are capable of transcending human limits, yet vulnerable and weak - cult members will be encouraged to confess their sins and denounce those of others. They will do so in an attempt to purge themselves or the group itself of impurities - in the form of forbidden thoughts, feelings, actions, experiences or knowledge - that are presented to them as signs of evil. The act of performing contempt toward that which deserves only contempt becomes a cleansing ritual for them.

Lifton calls this the *cult of confession*, in which

> Confession is carried beyond its ordinary religious, legal, and therapeutic expressions to the point of becoming a cult in itself. There is the demand that one confess to crimes one has not committed, to sinfulness that is artificially induced, in the name of a cure that is arbitrarily imposed. Such demands are made possible not only by the ubiquitous human tendencies toward guilt and shame but also by the need to give expression to these tendencies. In totalist hands, confession becomes a means of exploiting, rather than offering solace for, these vulnerabilities.

But it's perhaps more useful to think of this as a variant of the *cult of denunciation* - the followers are made to denounce what is evil and impure, whether in themselves or in someone else. In cults that lay more emphasis upon the followers' sinfulness and flawed nature and psychologize the evil as internal to the individual, there may be an expectation to denounce oneself rather than others - to confess to one's own sins. In those that lay more emphasis upon the followers' special qualities and personify the evil as an external enemy, there may be an expectation to denounce others - to perform a Two Minutes Hate against them every so often.

This, too, is characteristic of Ur-Fascism, in the form of hatred of enemies and traitors as well as contempt for those who are unmanly:

> Thinking is a form of emasculation. Therefore culture is suspect insofar as it is identified with critical attitudes. Distrust of the intellectual world has always been a symptom of Ur-Fascism, from Goering's alleged statement ("When I hear talk of culture I reach for my gun") to the frequent use of such expressions as "degenerate intellectuals," "eggheads," "effete snobs," "universities are a nest of reds." The official Fascist intellectuals were mainly engaged in attacking modern culture and the liberal intelligentsia for having betrayed traditional values.
>
> [...] Since both permanent war and heroism are difficult games to play, the Ur-Fascist transfers his will to power to sexual matters. This is the origin of machismo (which implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits, from chastity to homosexuality).

It seems to me that this is the connection between fascism and other kinds of cults. The emotional catharsis that cultic ideologies offer can come through the interplay of self-hatred, guilt and confession, or hatred of the other, narcissistic pride in one's own group, contempt for outsiders and denunciation. Cults that emphasize the former can look very different from cults that emphasize the latter, but beneath the surface the same dynamics are at work.

Most cults in fact emphasize both to some degree - where there are confessions, there are usually also denunciations, and where there are denunciations, there is always the fear that one might be next. The utopian promise is always accompanied by the dystopian threat, and conversely the dystopian universe is always justified by an appeal to utopianism - in the case of fascism, a world where the followers will no longer have to feel attacked or humiliated by their enemies, a world that will bring out their best qualities and turn each of them into a hero, unmoved by selfish or petty interests, acting only out of duty to the community and willing to lay down their lives in the service of a greater cause.

Cultic control is thus achieved through a combination of opposing polarities, through hope and fear, idealization and devaluation, salvation and damnation, eternal life and annihilation, and through the identification of these polarities with two distinct warring tribes. To the extent that fascism exerts control over its followers, it does so in a way that uses precisely these techniques. So not only does it make sense to understand fascism as a cult, but it might also add to our knowledge of cults if we try to understand them as a category that includes fascism.
