title: "How to Learn Stuff: Part 1 of I'm-Still-Figuring-This-Out"

Throughout young adulthood, I found it extremely difficult to learn things because I would always get caught up in hunting for the Fundamental Meaning of the thing I was trying to learn. 

Whenever I learnt a new concept or encountered a new idea, I would eagerly try to learn everything about it - and at some point, fall into staring dreamily at it, allowing it to metamorphose into a metaphor for life, the universe and everything. Once I'd passed this point, there was no going back. I could no longer simply use the concept the way it was meant to be used - it had to be a symbol for some deep truth I had been searching for.

And I would frantically try to take it apart to find the deep truth, not realizing that this was like breaking a mirror to reach the objects I saw in it. That I'd never find the truth because there was no truth, there was only a reflected image of my own fragmented thoughts.

Since I understood this, it's become much easier to learn things without getting distracted by those images. I don't try to find a metaphor for thought itself in the Fourier transform, or for history in differential equations, or for society in algorithms. I do still draw on these ideas for analogies - but I know where the analogy stops, and when I can't push it any further. I don't place the burden of supporting the analogy on the abstract concept, and then deform my understanding of the concept to support it. That means that the concepts feel lighter, spring more easily into their natural shape, and do what they do well and no more. They feel less like portals to another reality, and more like signposts for finding my way around my own reality.

But for someone in the position I was then, I don't think it would have been enough to take the burden off those concepts. There would have to be something else to support that burden. Nearly a decade later, I know what I was searching for and where it is to be found and what language exists for the purpose of talking about it. But at the time, I didn't have this language, and I didn't know.

The one thing I wish my younger self had known (but of course, younger selves can never know these things) is that Fundamental Meaning doesn't exist in things. There's an illusion of Fundamental Meaning that things can give you sometimes, but any curious, sceptical, intellectually honest human will quickly investigate it deeply enough to figure out its illusory character. And when everything crumbles into dust between their fingers, it can lead to despair and uncontrollable nihilism. 

It doesn't exist anywhere, really, not like that, dressed up in capital letters. It emerges from the interstices of life, usually contradictory and confusing, but sometimes in happy confluence so that the illusion becomes as real as it will ever be. If that confluence is captured anywhere, it's in art, and nowhere else. People who try to find it elsewhere are usually people whose lives are deprived of art, as mine was.

Things themselves, meanwhile, are just things. And I can love them for that, placing no unreasonable expectations on them. A lot of advice for learning to use concepts insists that you should just jump right in and start using them and that's how you'll learn - but that doesn't work for people like me, who don't even know how to start. What people like me need to do is to understand the goal that the concept aims to achieve, *take that goal seriously* (most of my learning has been learning to take human society and its goals seriously), and then understand what's required to achieve it (so they need to see the larger picture, and how the concept fits in with the dozens of other concepts in that picture). Then they'll know why the concept exists, and then they can start using it.

Of course, I love the concepts a little less than I did before, now that they don't carry the weight of all that was important to me. But I think the other kind of love was unhealthy anyway. It's better, I think, to love abstractions less, than to love them excessively for something they never were. 

I'm still excited to meet them once in a while, to play with them, have long crazy conversations and do cool things together. But I know there's something else I want that they're never going to give me, and when I start longing for that, I leave them and go on my way.
