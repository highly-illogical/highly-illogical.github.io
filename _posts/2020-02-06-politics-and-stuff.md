title: Politics and Stuff I Don't Know Where Else To Talk About
---

For nearly a year now, I've been trying to write _something_, _somewhere_, about politics.

I'm not sure exactly why this endeavour has been so unsuccessful. But I am sure that other people who've been trying to do the same thing haven't found it easy either. Wait But Why's series [The Story of Us](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/08/story-of-us.html) goes into painstaking detail about that. I'm going to skip all that detail (because if I don't, I'll never get started) and instead jump right into the middle of things.

Until recently, I thought of myself as being "on the left". To me, being on the left meant wanting a better, fairer world - one that everyone felt was worth living in, not one that was sunshine and roses for some and intolerable for others. It meant trying to see the ways in which the status quo hurt, crushed and tore down certain kinds of people, and taking a stand against that, and trying to change it. It meant remembering that we were all human, and that no human being was inherently worth more than any other, and the contentment and ease of one person at the cost of the life and dignity of another was unjustifiable. All ideologies that had ever been associated with the left - socialism, communism, anarchism, feminism, antiracism - were in some way an expression of these things. These were their intentions, if not always their actual achievements.

Now, though, I don't quite know if that's the word. I hope it is - I hope I wasn't wrong in perceiving these to be the ideals of the left. But much of what passes itself off as the left today has nothing to do with these things, and too much to do with things I want no part of. This is what I want to talk about, and don't know where to talk about.

I've seen a lot of behaviour on the left that is at best counterproductive, and at worst... well, at worst, what I'm seeing is not the left but some kind of grotesque undead version of it that superficially resembles it but is empty of its soul, its essence. But I'll be optimistic and go with "counterproductive" for now.

Leftist infighting of the [People's-Front-of-Judea-vs.-Judean-People's-Front](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iS-0Az7dgRY) variety is, of course, nothing new. Nor is the generous exchange of insults such as "revisionist", "reactionary", "imperialist", "fascist" and "liberal" _between people on the left_. But I think for a long time, I associated this only with the extreme left - the tiny cultish sects that were no more than curiosities, at least since the disintegration of the Soviet Union. In particular, I believed that the majority of the left had empathy and understanding for those who were unlike them - whether these were people of a different race, or religion, or nationality - or a different political ideology. Because beneath all these differences there lay a fundamental humanity, and that was what connected us all. That was the foundation of the left.

But what I see in practice is that the left is far more caught up in distinguishing itself from the right than in defending its own ideals. It defines itself by who it isn't, rather than by what it is. The ur-insult of the left is not - as one might expect - "cruel", "inhuman", "hypocritical" or even "privileged", but "right-wing". You can be anything else and still be on the left, but the one thing you must not be is "right-wing". What this means is clear: the left is no longer a political movement held together by common ideals, values and goals. It's a tribe held together by a common enemy.

This, too, is at least as old as the identification of socialism with the Soviet Union. It reminds me of this oft-quoted passage from Solzhenitsyn:

> "If only it were all so simple! If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?"

Whether the left-as-tribe can still be true to the founding ideals of the left-as-philosophy-and-movement, I don't know. At the very least, there seems to be a contradiction there - either you can try to change the world to make it better, fairer and more equal for everyone no matter what their politics, or you can burn all the right-wingers at the stake and hope that this will eliminate evil from the earth. You can't do both.

Ideally, perhaps, in the very process of the world becoming better and fairer and more equal, some kind of tipping point will occur where people on the right realize that they can't beat the left, and so had better join them, and they'll all slide over to the left. This story has played out many times, and it will play out again. But that only happens when the left remains a philosophy and a movement, and does not turn into a tribe. If it does, and if it starts to see itself as fighting a war with evil rather than struggling to improve the world it shares with others, it will end up both abandoning and discrediting its ideals.

Like the women in the King Solomon story who both claimed the child belonged to them, there are many who claim that the values of the left belong to them. Perhaps, then, the way to judge is the same - which of them are willing to give up their claim in order to preserve the values, and which will not renounce it even at the cost of betraying and destroying every one of those values? Perhaps only those who are willing to be accused of being "right-wing" for the sake of the left's ideals have ever truly been of the left.

I'll end this post here, but not this topic. I have much more to say about it, and this is only a start.
