title: "(Critique of)<sup>n</sup> Critique"
---

I don't think it's an accident that the first work Marx and Engels jointly wrote was subtitled ["Critique of Critical Criticism"](https://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/holy-family/index.htm).

I haven't read it. But the subtitle references a tendency of thought on the left that I'm all too familiar with: the only way to disagree with someone is by critiquing their critique as not radical enough.

Now that I've typed it out, it seems odd and funny to me. Why should this be the case? Why can't you disagree with someone because their proposals are unrealistic, or not thought through well, or proceed from incorrect assumptions? Why can't you criticize them for not looking closely enough at the facts or the details of what they're analyzing? Why can't you refuse to accept their plan for a better society because it makes tradeoffs that you consider unacceptable?

I think I know the answer to the last one (from reading a lot of Thomas Sowell). The left doesn't *believe* in tradeoffs. To the extent that the left contains a utopian impulse, it's convinced that we can have it all. We don't need to give up some goods to secure others. We don't have to choose between this *or* that. There's no such thing as scarcity. It's capitalism that convinces us that there is, that we have to make these choices and give up some things to secure others. The entire *idea* of socialism is that we live in a world of abundance, where there's more than enough for everyone. The ruling classes create the illusion that there isn't enough because they want to hoard more than their fair share. When the scales fall from our collective eyes, we will revolt against this lie and [transition from the realm of necessity into the realm of freedom](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/3184548-the-realm-of-freedom-actually-begins-only-where-labour-which), into the socialist utopia of abundance.

But what about the others? Historically, such disagreements have arisen on the left, though usually only as disagreements about political strategy. Marx [famously disagreed with Bakunin](https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bakunin/bio/robertson-ann.htm) on the question of how and when the state ought to be abolished to bring about the transition to socialism. Lenin wrote a polemic against ["Left-Wing" Communism](https://www.socialist.net/left-wing-communism-an-infantile-disorder-a-reading-guide.htm) arguing that flexible tactics were necessary in times of revolution. It's certainly not true that people on the left have *never* charged each other with being unrealistic or not thinking things through.

But take a bird's-eye view of how the left has evolved over a century and a half, and it's apparent that there's been little real examination of the philosophical premises upon which it rests. Almost all theoretical progress is really an attempt to figure out *why there hasn't been a revolution yet*, to find the cause in the ever-growing cunning of the ruling classes, and to enumerate all the ways in which they pacify the working classes and pull the wool right back over their eyes. The idea of revolution itself is not questioned or critically examined, but, like the God of the Scholastics, treated as essentially unknowable yet reinterpreted in endless new ways in every era.

In this way of thinking, reason is not treated as an instrument of critical thinking but as an instrument of rationalization. It's well-illustrated by [a comment made by AOC in an interview last year](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/01/07/alexandria-ocasio-cortezs-very-bad-defense-her-falsehoods/), in which she said

> I think that thereâ€™s a lot of people more concerned about being precisely, factually, and semantically correct than about being morally right.

This isn't just a politician's fumbling defense against a pointed question (although it is that too). It's a way of thinking that's so deeply embedded in the psyche of the left as to be taken for granted. It's a consequence of the belief that our consciousness is merely a product of our class interests. If this is the case, then the content of someone's speech and ideas only has meaning in terms of the class interests it advances, and the only standards that we can hold it to are the standards of being on the correct political side.

But what do you do when there are lots of people on the *same* correct political side, but they still want to disagree with each other? What standards do you create to distinguish between them?

This is where the idea of critiquing your neighbour's critique comes in. Sure, maybe everyone *thinks* they're on the same side, but are they really? If consciousness is just an expression of class interests, then couldn't this consciousness be deluded into thinking itself revolutionary, while actually advancing the same class interests in a subtle, disguised manner? Might it not, like the existing ruling ideology, try to present itself as having a legitimate claim to rule because its ideas are in the universal interest of society, while in fact they are merely in its own particular interest? Can ideology *infiltrate critique* by disguising itself as critique?

If such a thing is possible (and there is no reason why it should not be), then every critique in its turn has to be unmasked as disguised status-quo politics by an even more radical critique. The only people *truly* on the correct political side, who are the rightful heirs to the revolutionary throne, are those whose critique cannot be critiqued by anyone.

This is why, if you look at the left today, all you'll find will be endless critiques of critiques of critiques. The Marxist critiques are unmasked as sexist by feminists, the feminist critiques are unmasked as racist by anti-racists, the anti-racist critiques are unmasked as insufficiently queer by queer theorists, and the queer critiques appear to have sidestepped all critique by claiming that everything truly revolutionary is actually queer (have to admit, this is the smartest move I've seen yet). To be truly queer apparently means to be beyond all norms and categories in some vague, undefined sense (to define it would be un-queer) and hence the queerer your critique, the more radical it is.

There's a possibility that this might be the endgame, and after this is all over we can get to thinking about what was wrong with the game itself. But I'm not too hopeful about that. It's more likely that when we're exhausted with critiquing critiques of critiques, we'll simply move on to [revolutionizing the revolutionary revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Soviet_split).
